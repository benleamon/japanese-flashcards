#Japanese Flashcards
This is a collection of Japanese flashcards I've made for my personal use. It is highly likely here are mistakes. If there are, please feel free to submit edits via github or let me know.  

## To Use the flashcards: 
Either download the files you want, or clone the repository to your computer to get future updates. 

If using Anki you can import the CSV files directly to the Anki app on your computer, and then sync to your other devices. Once the list is updated you will have to re-import the CSV, however this will not impact the counts on your previously-studied cards.
